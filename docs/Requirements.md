# IoT Multicloud Security System with Facial Recognition

### Project Overview:
This project aims to develop an advanced security system that leverages IoT devices, facial recognition technology, and multicloud infrastructure to provide a robust, scalable, and secure monitoring solution. The system will allow real-time monitoring, detection, and response to unauthorized access across multiple physical and cloud environments, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and system resilience.

### Functional Requirements:
1.⁠ ⁠Facial Recognition Module:
   - Capture real-time video feed from IoT cameras.
   - Implement a facial recognition algorithm to identify authorized and unauthorized individuals.
   - Provide real-time notifications and alerts if an unauthorized person is detected.

2.⁠ ⁠Multicloud Integration:
   - Distribute data and computing across multiple cloud providers to ensure availability, redundancy, and fault tolerance.
   - Support secure data transfer and storage across the selected cloud environments (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).

3.⁠ ⁠Data Encryption and Security:
   - Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest across all cloud environments.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to secure access to different components of the system.

4.⁠ ⁠IoT Device Management:
   - Enable remote control, monitoring, and management of IoT devices connected to the system.
   - Allow automatic updates to IoT devices’ firmware for maintaining security patches.

5.⁠ ⁠Real-time Notification System:
   - Develop a notification system to send alerts through SMS, email, or a mobile application when unauthorized access is detected.
   - Configure escalation protocols based on alert severity levels.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
1.⁠ ⁠Scalability: 
   - Ensure the system supports an increasing number of IoT devices and data without performance degradation.
   
2.⁠ ⁠Reliability:
   - Provide high uptime by leveraging multicloud redundancy and failover mechanisms.

3.⁠ ⁠Performance:
   - Ensure low latency in real-time recognition and alerting functionalities.

4.⁠ ⁠Compliance:
   - Adhere to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) by ensuring secure handling and storage of facial recognition data.

### Project Tasks:
1.⁠ ⁠Requirements Analysis and Planning:
   - Gather detailed requirements and design system architecture.
   - Identify key technologies for facial recognition, IoT integration, and multicloud management.

2.⁠ ⁠Functional Size Measurement:
   - Measure the functional size of the system using either Function Point Analysis, the COSMIC method, NESMA estimation (HLFPA), or Simple Function Point (SFP).

3.⁠ ⁠Development:
   - Implement facial recognition, IoT integration, cloud-based data management, and security features.
   
4.⁠ ⁠Testing and Validation:
   - Conduct functional and security tests to ensure reliability and compliance.
   - Perform load testing to confirm scalability.

5.⁠ ⁠Deployment and Documentation:
   - Deploy the system across selected cloud platforms.
   - Document the system architecture, configuration, and user instructions.
