# IoT Multicloud Security System with Facial Recognition

### Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced security system that leverages IoT devices, facial recognition technology, and multicloud infrastructure. The system will allow real-time monitoring, detection, and response to unauthorized access across multiple physical and cloud environments.

### Functional Requirements

1. **IoT Device Management:** Facilitates remote monitoring, control, and automatic firmware updates for IoT devices, maintaining security with the latest patches.

   - **Fields:** IoT, Electronics

2. **Real-time Notification System:** Sends alerts via SMS, email, or mobile apps when unauthorized access is detected, with alert severity determining the escalation protocols for proper response.

   - **Fields:** Software, Networks

3. **Facial Recognition:** The system uses live video from IoT cameras and recognition algorithms to identify individuals, alerting when unauthorized persons are detected.
   
   - **Fields:** AI, Computer Vision

4.  **Multicloud System:** Ensures data and computing resources are spread across multiple cloud providers to guarantee availability and fault tolerance.

   - **Fields:** Cloud Computing, Distributed Systems

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Scalability:** The system efficiently scales to accommodate growing numbers of IoT devices and users without degradation in performance.

2. **Reliability:** The system maintains continuous operation and remains resilient to failures, ensuring seamless functionality even when parts of the infrastructure face issues.

3. **Performance:** The system delivers prompt alerts and smooth operations, particularly during scenarios requiring rapid decision-making and low latency.

4. **Compliance:** The system provides the necessary logging and audit data to support adherence to privacy regulations, enabling effective data management and protection of individuals' privacy.
